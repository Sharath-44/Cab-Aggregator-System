## Cab Aggregator System
Booking the right cab for the right customer at the right time is an important problem for cab aggregators. This project aims to solve this problem by predicting the estimated time of arrival (ETA) of cabs to customer locations. The project is divided into two parts and is built using C++:
1. [Creating helper functions](#helper-functions)
2. [Building the User Interface](#user-interface)

## Helper Functions
The helper functions are used to read the input data, store it in a data structure, and perform operations on the data structure. The data structure used is a hash table. The following operations are performed on the data structure:
1. [Inserting a new record](#inserting-a-new-record)
2. [Deleting an existing record](#deleting-an-existing-record)
